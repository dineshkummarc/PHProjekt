    <b>Statistic tab</b><br />
    <br />
    This is a very simple module, it shows all the worked hours for each user on the Projects you have at least Read
    access to, classifying them by Projects (and Sub-Projects) showing them in an organized chart table.<br />
    Those worked hours correspond to the ones the users have charged using Timecard module.<br />
    <br />
    There is a panel over it, 'Selected Statistic Timeline' that allows you to specify the period for the module to
    calculate the hours in.<br />

    <b>Selected Statistic Period</b><br />
    <br />
    This panel up the Projects time table, allows you to select a specific period of time for the table.<br />
    It means that, for example, if you choose in both fields 2009-01-01 and 2009-01-31 respectively, and press the
    checkbox button, the table will be done according to the hours charged in Timecard for that period.<br />

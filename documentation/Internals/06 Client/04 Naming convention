The Naming Convention in our own dojo classes are the result of trying to make the client as similar to the Server as 
possible and trying to consider the dojo naming conventions.

As a result we have the following Naming Conventions used within our dojo classes:

module	      	lowercase	                (e.g. phpr)
class	      	CamelCase	                (e.g. Default)
public method 	mixedCase					(e.g  phpr.initWidgets)
public var	  	mixedCase					(e.g. availableModules)	
constant	  	CamelCase or UPPER_CASE
private method	_mixedCase					
private var		_mixedCase					(e.g. _node)
method args		_mixedCase, mixedCase       (e.g. _filterResponse)
local vars		_mixedCase, mixedCase

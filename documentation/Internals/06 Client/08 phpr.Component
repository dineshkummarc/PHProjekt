The Component Submodule provides the methods which are needed by all PHProjekt Components.
At the moment PHProjekt consists of the components 'Tree', 'Form', and 'Grid'.

All those classes extend the Component.js class.

At this point the Component.js only provides a function to render a specific content underneath a given node.

The render function uses the dojox.dtl.Template class for rendering the templates and automatically initializes 
widgets wich are provided in the template that is rendered.

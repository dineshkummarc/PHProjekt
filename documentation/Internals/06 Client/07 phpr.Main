This is the Main class, which always needs to be loaded when using the PHProjekt Client.

The main purpose of this class is to require all other classe which we need for the PHProjekt Client.

We don't load the different widgets and classe when they are really needed, but from the beginning within the phpr.Main
class. As a result we can rely on the dojo publish and subscribe Methods for Communication between the Components
and we don't need to implement any dispatcher logic ourself.

The phpr.Main class doesn't extend any other dojo class.
All is does is to instantiate all the Main classes for our PHProjekt Modules and to publish the load method
of the Module which is supposed to be shown when logging in ot PHProjekt.

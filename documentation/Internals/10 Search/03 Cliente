On the client, there is a text input for search.

On any keyup, if the text have more than 2 letters,
the "suggestion" box is displayed.
This box contain the most popular words with the input as a substring.
This box only show a number of results, now setted on 10.

If you click on one result,
all the results are displayed in the place where are the grid,
and in the detail view you will see the item itself.

The other way for search is just type something and press enter,
and the results will be displayed in the place where are the grid.

There is a delay between you write a letter and the search run.
This is for prevent a query per character if you write
the entire word directly.

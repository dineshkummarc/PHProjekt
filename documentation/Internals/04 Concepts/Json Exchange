PHProjekt offers a JSON interface to interact between a JSON enabled client and PHProjekt.
Data can be received calling json actions and can be saved using a usual POST to the server.

The data send from the server is a json representation of the server side models that implement
the Phprojekt_Models_Interface. In addtion to that, while quering the server for data, you 
get the meta information about the data, which is provided by the Phprojekt_ModelInformation_Interface.
Usualle the default model for a controller can be received using the jsonList or jsonForm action depending on which
sorting you want to have (see the sorting chapter for more information). 

A detailed information about the exchange format can be found in the [emph]Data cExchange Format[/emph] section.

[emph]Sorting[/emph]
Since the first days of PHProjekt's Module Designer, the module designer offered the possiblity to sort
list columns in a other order than the formular data. To make a migration possible PHProjekt 6 supports
this attemp by providing two different calls to get data from the server. 
If you want to get the list sorting you usually call jsonList (which is implemented in the jsonListAction() method), 
while getting the data using a form sorting can be done by jsonForm. The metadata send to you is exactly the same
just with different ordering. In addition to that, the jsonList call will return a complete set of available data,
while the jsonForm call will always return exactly one record from the database.

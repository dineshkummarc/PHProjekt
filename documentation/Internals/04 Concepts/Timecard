- Option to automatically start/stop timecard when logging in/off from PHProjekt
- The working time stop/start Button will be on every page on the top right corner.
  We will use a clock as a symbol. Doubleclicking this clock will start/stop timecard
- right or single click will show the manual booking of working time  as well as
  an overview over the working time booked so far.
- on the right hand side there is a button Timecard for every (sub) project
- When accessing this button on the root level all time booked on projects is shown,
  when accessing this button on a subproject only time booked beneath this project   is shown
- book time on projects: in the list view on the right hand side and as well in booked
  working time  overview of the timecard or in the project itself. 
- book time on todos/helpdesk: either in todo directly, or in the todo list view

To delete a data, find it and delete it. 

Please notice that all related items will be delted too.

As always, you have to do a initial find first.

[code]
$project = new Phprojekt_Project(array('db'=>$zend_db_adapter));
$project->find(40);
// DELETE THE PROJECT AND ALL RELATED ITEMS 
// (ALL TODOS RELATED TO THIS PROJECT)
$project->delete();
[/code]

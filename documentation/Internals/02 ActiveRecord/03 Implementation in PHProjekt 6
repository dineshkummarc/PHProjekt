PHProjekt 6 provide the ActiveRecord pattern
through the class Phprojekt_ActiveRecord_Abstract
which resides in the /application/Phprojekt/ActiveRecord/Abstract.php file.

To use the functionallity you have to extend the class.
The ActiveRecord base class automaticly maps the last
part of the extended class to the database using a simple name convention.

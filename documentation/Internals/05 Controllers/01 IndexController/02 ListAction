The list action is called for get the list of items.

Every dojox.data.QueryReadStore has to (and does) return "start" and "count" for paging.
This is also used for loading a grid on demand (initially only a part is shown, scrolling down loads what is needed).

The request can be:

- Module/jsonList
Return all the items with projectId = null
For project module, return all the project with parent = null

- Module/jsonList/nodeId/xx
Return all the items with projectId = xx
For project module, return all the project with parent = xx

- Module/jsonList/id/xx
Return only the items with id = xx
For project module, return only the project with id = xx

PHProjekt has a hierarchical project tree.
Rights are applied to the modules for each project node,
and each item in it has their own rights.

Every item like an todo, a calendar entry, etc is owned by an project.
Items without an project relation will be owned by the root project.

Example:
   /ROOT
   	  -> Project 1
		-> Project 3
		    -> Project 4
		-> Project 5
	  -> Project 2

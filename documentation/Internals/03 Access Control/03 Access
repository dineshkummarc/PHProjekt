- Access System
The access system is applied to each item.
You can assign none, read, write, access, create, copy,
delete, download, or admin access to the item for each user.
Example:
    Todo:
        Item 1
            User 1:
                - Read
                - Write
                - Download
            User 2:
                - Admin
            User 3:
                - None
        Item 2
            User 1:
                - Admin
            User 2:
                - Read
                - Write
                - Download
                - Copy
                - Delete
                - Access
            User 3:
                - Read
                - Write
                - Delete

- Definitions:
None access:   Don´t allow to see the item.
Read access:   Allow to see the item.
Write access:  Allow to update the item.
Access access: Allow to Passthrough.
    The user has access to the project and subprojects
    In a hierarchical structure this means,
    that the user is able to see subnodes but isn't
    able to read the node itself. A tree like

	/ROOT
	   -> Project 1  			(read, access)
		  -> NOT VISIBLE 	    (access)
				-> Project 5    (read, access)
			->Project 4		    (read, access)
		-> Project 2			(read, access)

    will be displayed.
    If a user doesn't have access to a project node due to his role,
    he isn't allowed to view elements from the subtree even he has access rights there.
Create access: Is not used now.
Copy access:  Allow to copy an item.
Delete access: Allow to delete the item.
Download access:  Allow to download the item (For files).
Admin access: Allow to do all, include the asssign of access.

- Relations with users
In each item, the user can assign these rights for each users.
The current user (the owner or with admin access), can´t change their access.

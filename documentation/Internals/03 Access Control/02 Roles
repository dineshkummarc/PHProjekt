- Role System
The role system is applied to a module.
You can assign read, write, create, or admin access to each active module.
Example:
    Rolename:
        Senior Developer
    Rights:
        - Todos:
            - Read
            - Write
            - Create
        - Files:
            - Read
            - Write
        - Notes:
            - Admin

- Definitions:
Read access:   Allow to see all the items in the module.
Write access:  Allow to update all the items in the module.
Create access: Allow to create new items in the module.
Admin access:  Allow to do all in the module.

- Relations with users
In each project, the user can assign one role for each users.
The current user (the owner or with admin access), can´t change their role.
If the user don´t have a role for one project,
the parent project-role relation is used.
The first project-role relation (root project - role 1),
is used by default for all, and can´t be deleted.

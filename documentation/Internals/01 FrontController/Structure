Front controller – Index.php

The front controller is divided into various parts.


[emph]Path definition section[/emph]
Here will be defined all paths used by PHProjekt 6.
Nowhere else can be defined a path.

_ PHPR_ROOT_PATH is the path to the whole application.
_ PHPR_CORE_PATH is for the application directory
_ PHPR_LIBRARY_CLASS is for library directory
_ PHPR_CONFIG_FILE is the name of the config file (e.g. /www/config.ini)
_ PHPR_TEMP_PATH is the path to temporary files.

Any other path constant definition needs to be defined here.


[emph]Loader inclusion[/emph]
The loader is the only one file that will be required on PHProjekt 6.
All other files and class needs to be included automatically by the loader. 

If there is used require_once or
include_once into any other script probably there is an error.


[emph]Initialization[/emph]
Next step is the initialization of the Zend_Session,
load of configuration file and creation of the db connection.

Some objects are registered using Zend_Registry to be used on PHProjekt:
_ config with the configuration file content
_ db with the database connection 
_ log object
_ view object an Smarty helper


[emph]Translation[/emph]
The translation is made using the PHProjekt_Language class.

Currently it is using the configuration file to determine which language will be used.
On the future needs to be changes to a selection based on:
_ User language preference
_ User browser language setting 
_ Application configuration.

[emph]Front controller stuff[/emph]
After initialization there is the front controllers main stuff.

There is a scandir to find the available modules. 

At least the action is dispatched.
